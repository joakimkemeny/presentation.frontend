# Presentation.Frontend

This is the presentation files and demos for the presentation **Rethink your Frontend Architecture**

## Abstract

The users are becoming pickier and pickier about the applications they use. The applications must be fast, beautiful
and they should be usable from any computer or mobile phone. How can a modern architecture combined with modern
technologies help us create applications that meat their expectations?

Joakim will take a healthcare system, built as a typical web application in 2000s, and guide you through a demo where
new JavaScript frameworks and new technologies, such as WebSockets, gives the system a much better user experience.
He will show you that the new way of building applications also gives you other advantages and that it might enable
you to create new types of applications.

Hopefully this presentation and demo will convince you that it's time to rethink your frontend architecture

## Known issues

* The presentation crashes Safari for iPad.
* The presentation doesn't work in Internet Explorer and Opera.
* The presentation doesn't look good in Firefox.
* The source code doesn't show in Chrome unless served from a web server.

Long story short: It's made for Safari, I present it using Safari so Safari is probably the best
way to watch this presentation :-) Maybe I'll fix it in the future, maybe not.
